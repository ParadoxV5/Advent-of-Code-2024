# Observations:
# * The program is a single loop with a single print.
# * Each iteration calculates its output from the least-significant octal digit of A and then shifts it away when done.
# * Each output is determined from the current octal digit and unspecific bits that are not yet shifted.
#   * These bits are zero for the last couple of iterations, which are for the most-significant digits.
# Therefore, these octal digits are deducible starting from the most-significant.
